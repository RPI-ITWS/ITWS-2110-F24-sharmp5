Weather and Astronomy App
This project is a web application that retrieves weather data for Troy, NY, from the OpenWeatherMap API and the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) from the NASA API. Users can also input their own data for both weather and astronomy, which is then saved to a MySQL database. The user can retrieve saved data to view it on the webpage.

Features
-Fetch Weather Data: Displays current weather data for Troy, NY.
-Fetch Astronomy Data: Shows the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) with a title and description.
-User Input: Allows users to input their own weather data and APOD data.
-Data Storage: Saves user-inputted data to a MySQL database.
-Load Data from Database: Loads and displays stored data from the MySQL database on the webpage.
-User-Friendly Interface: Clear UI with buttons for fetching, updating, and loading data.

Technologies Used
-Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-Back-end: PHP
