Summary of Findings
Severity	Number of Issues
High	1
Medium	2
Low	3
Informational	2
Findings
High Severity
Description: SQL Injection
Details: The API endpoint does not sanitize user inputs, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
Remediation: Use prepared statements with parameterized queries for all database interactions.
Medium Severity
Description: Missing Security Headers

Location: Entire site
Details: The application lacks security headers like Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, and X-Frame-Options.
Remediation: Add these headers to the server configuration to mitigate common attacks like XSS, MIME-type sniffing, and clickjacking.
Description: Insecure Cookies

Location: Application-wide
Details: Cookies do not have the Secure and HttpOnly attributes set.
Remediation: Set the Secure attribute to ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS and HttpOnly to prevent client-side JavaScript from accessing them.
Low Severity
Description: Sensitive Data Exposure

Location: Update forms
Details: Input fields have autocomplete enabled, which could expose sensitive information.
Remediation: Add autocomplete="off" to sensitive input fields.
Informational
Description: Missing HTTPS

Location: Entire site
Details: The application does not enforce HTTPS for all connections.
Remediation: Enforce HTTPS by configuring your web server to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
Description: Directory Listing Enabled

Location: /var/www/html/
Details: The web server has directory listing enabled, exposing the structure of the application.
Remediation: Disable directory listing in your server configuration.
Recommendations
Implement Prepared Statements: Secure all database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
Add Security Headers: Configure Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, and X-Frame-Options in the web server.
Secure Cookies: Ensure all cookies are marked as Secure and HttpOnly.
